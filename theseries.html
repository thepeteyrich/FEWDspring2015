			<h1>MJ</h1>
			<h2>1/27</h2>
			<h3>Created 10.2.14</h3>
			<p>Two years ago, at this time, I needed a creative boost so I started sketching a serious of illustrations based off of one of my favorites logos off all time, the #AirJordan #Jumpman logo, created by #PeterMoore. I thought it would be fun to create a "jumpman-like" logo for other famous people too and it started to take off. Due to various reasons, I had to put the project on hold, but I'm now ready to re-visit it. You'll see them posted here, once every Thursday, and eventually I'll make prints. Those of you in Brooklyn and NYC will see them on walls too if you keep your üëÄ open. It makes the most sense to start with this one, as both #MJ's played such a major role in my upbringing. Keep creating. And Don't stop til you get enough.</p>

			<h3>Created 10.9.14</h3>
			<p>Forrest Gump is a 1994 American epic romantic-comedy-drama film based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field. The story depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump, a slow-witted and na√Øve, but good-hearted and athletically prodigious man from Alabama who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century in the United States; more specifically, the period between Forrest's birth in 1944 and 1982. The film differs substantially from Winston Groom's novel on which it was based, including Gump's personality and several events that were depicted.</p>
			<p>The film won the 67th Academy Awards for the Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Director, Best Visual Effects, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing.</p>

			<p>Nine years ago, I found out there was a cool exhibit going on at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Downtown LA. I didn't know what to expect. I knew of the name Jean-Michel Basquiat and had heard he was a famous graffiti artist from Brooklyn but that was it. That exhibit is still, to this day, the most inspiring collection of work I have ever seen.</p><p>In 1985, photographer Michael Halsband created his most iconic photograph for a promotional poster for Andy Warhol and Basquiat's collaborative exhibition. It is probably my favorite portrait ever taken and has been reproduced in millions of ways a over the world (including the street art I posted a few grams ago). Look it up. And print it. And post it everywhere. So this entry to the series is also for him. But simply put, Basquiat is MY DUDE and his legend will always live on. Or at least until Jay Z runs out of ways to throw him into his songs.</p>

			<p>Easily my favorite athlete growing up and is still my vote for greatest baseball player that ever lived, Ken Griffey Jr. made everything cool. I copied him as much as I could from deciding that center field would be my position, taping my bat the way he did, and turning my hat around backwards during practice. He had the SWEETEST swing and was on pace to shatter the HR record had he not gotten injured so frequently. Let's not forget that The Kid was probably even better at defense than he was at hitting long balls; 10 gold gloves.</p>
			<p> I'll always remember one Phillies game that I attended with my boy @clodaddy ...we sat front row in centerfield at #TheVet and made a sign that said "Griffey Sucks" on one side. When we finally got his attention between innings, he turned around and put his hand to his ear as if he couldn't hear us. So we screamed it louder and pointed at the sign. It was only then that we realized he was actually rubbing his enormous diamond earring. He could hear us just fine. We calmly proceeded to sit back down. He had IT, man. Forever my favorite. Long live #24.</p>

			<h3>Created 12.11.14</h3>
			<p>In 1996, the #Philadelphia #76ers drafted an undersized guard from #Georgetown (originally #Hampton, VA) with the #1 overall pick. He was the perfect icon for the city. Gritty, fast, and didn't care about throwing his body into the paint to become the MVP that he was. His style and swagger defined a new type of Hero. Skeptics hated that he was the new face of the #NBA. He was Hip-Hop. He was Heart. He was The Answer. He crossed up #Jordan as a rookie. No one was allowed to do that, but he was fearless.</p>
			<p>In 2001, the year he won his MVP, he lead the Sixers to the NBA finals where they ran into a heavyweight of heavyweights; the Kobe and Shaq lead LA Lakers. No one gave #Philly a shot. But A.I. didn't care. He went into LA, dropped a casual 48, crossed up Tyronn Lue in the corner to ice it, and then stepped (see: stomped) over him which became one of the most visually dominant images in sports history.</p>

			<h3>Created 12.18.14</h3>
			<p>I'm not sure if there is anyone out there who doesn't know who Bruce Lee is, but if that's you then quietly google him underneath your rock. A Chinese martial arts legend (and fellow Pac 12 product, shout out to the Huskies?!), Bruce was in a league of his own. Known as The Dragon to some, Bruce Lee's actual nickname is Sai-fon which translates to Little Phoenix. Arguably his generation's greatest athlete, Lee would wow crowds with his flying high kicks and other worldly strength. He was actually literally told that his punches and kicks were TOO FAST for the camera frame rate to capture at the time so he had to slow them down. Wut. He also once accidentally knocked out Jackie Chan. Google "best story ever, Jackie chan Bruce Lee". It's fantastic.</p>
			<p>A buddy of mine and my former creative director @doservewell used to refer to our design group as the Ninjas, which is still one of the coolest things I've ever been called. Well ...that, and Uncle Petey. So this one is also a shout out to Patrick Fong, the Sensei.</p>

			<h1>The 619</h1>
			<h2>13/27</h2>
			<h3>Created 1.1.15</h3>
			<p>In January of 2005 I was still considering my options for where to attend college. I had narrowed down my choices to the University of Southern California and the University of Cincinnati (due to their highly regarded architecture program). There were three things that ultimately made my decision easy. 1) My brother, Scotty, asked me simply: "If architecture doesn't work out, what city would you rather be in?" 2) On my last campus tour at SC, in January mind you, the entire freshman quad was lined with girls in bikinis "studying". 3) On January 4th, USC was playing Oklahoma for the National Championship. They destroyed Oklahoma for the title but there was a specific moment where Reggie Bush broke a run down the right sideline and the legendary Verne Lundquist had the call: "Ladies and Gentleman, meet Mr. Bush." I was hooked. I was forever a Trojan after that.</p>

			<p>I have about a thousand stories of him but the first time I saw Reggie live in person was at home vs. an Arkansas Razorback team that featured a backfield of Peyton Hillis, Felix Jones, and Darren McFadden. Literally the first two times Reggie touched the ball in that game he scored a TD; A 75 yard run up the middle pointing at the student section as he crossed the goal line, and a wheel route, caught one handed in the end zone. I'll never forget either. USC won that game 70-17.</p>
			</p> Sorry Brent Celek, but I made the right decision. </p>
			<p>Reggie was the most electrifying college football player I've ever seen. Unfortunately, his reputation is scarred due to one bad decision and one unfortunate collection of idiots named the "NCAA" but those who saw him play know... The kid from Helix High in San Diego (the 619 that he repped on his eyeblack), could straight up ball.</p>

			<p>Pictured above is Mr. Bush doing a front flip over a defender from the public school in Westwood. Fight on. ‚úåÔ∏è</p>

			<h3>Created 1.15.14</h3>
			<p>I'm tired of acting like Jay Z isn't my favorite rapper. In high school it was Biggie, the Roots, or Eminem. In college Lupe Fiasco and Kanye kept my pulse. But if we are looking at total career, and how many songs of his I truly know, HOVA is king. I've been fortunate enough to see him live a few times including my favorite birthday ever that involved a surprise limo ride in LA. full of my best friends, courtesy of @kara_elyse_alter. That will forever be an amazing memory. But now that I have made Brooklyn my home, I am starting to recognize a lot more of the references Jay makes in his rhymes (the same way Tupac/Snoop/Kendrick, among others, made living in LA so fun when I was there).</p>

			<p>Shawn Corey Carter was born in Brooklyn, NY, and was raised in Marcy Houses, a housing project in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. He attended George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School in Downtown BK, with The Notorious B.I.G. and Busta Rhymes. According to his mother, Jay used to wake up his siblings at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table. Eventually, she bought him a boom box for his birthday, sparking his interest in music. He began freestyling and writing lyrics. In his neighborhood, Shawn was known as "Jazzy", a nickname that eventually developed into his rap name, "Jay-Z" (he's since dropped the hyphen). Unfortunately, his nickname was NOT earned because he lived off the J/M/Z subway line like I've told the majority of people that have visited me in Brooklyn. Apologies ;). Unlike his wife, I have flaws.</p>

			<p>Jigga has been known to do all his rhymes in one take and not write any of his lyrics down. A few of my favorites are: ‚ÄúIf skills sold, truth be told, I‚Äôd probably be lyrically, Talib Kweli/ Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense/ But I did five mill‚Äô ‚Äî I ain‚Äôt been rhymin like Common since.‚Äù‚Ä¶and...‚ÄúI father, I Brooklyn Dodger them/ I jack, I rob, I sin/ Awww man, I‚Äôm Jackie Robinson/ Except when I run base, I dodge the pen.‚Äù...and of course‚Ä¶‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a businessman/ I‚Äôm a business, mannNNNNN!

			<h1>The Bride</h1>
			<h2>16/27</h2>
			<h3>Created 1.29.14</h3>
			<p>Beatrix Kiddo aka The Bride aka Black Mamba is hands down one of the most bad ass characters of all time (male or female). So I gladly wanted to make her the official first lady of The Jumpman Series (if we are not including Tyron Lue). The character starred in the Kill Bill franchise created by Quentin Tarantino and was played by Uma Thurman. Kiddo is a former member of the "Deadly Viper Assassination Squad", an elite, shadowy group of assassins. A formidable, ruthless warrior trained under martial arts master Pai Mei, she served at the right hand of Bill, her boss and love. Kiddo, a master of the Hung Gar style of kung fu, is the only Viper to learn the "Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique", a method of killing a person by quickly striking five pressure points around the heart with the fingertips. After the victim takes five steps, the heart explodes and he/she falls dead. Pai Mei supposedly refused to teach this technique, which was said to be "the deadliest blow in all of martial arts", to Bill or anyone else. Kiddo's determination wins his respect, however, and he teaches her the forbidden technique - a secret that Kiddo withholds from Bill until they meet for their final showdown.</p>

			<p>One of my favorite scenes in any movie ever is when The Bride takes on the Crazy 88. 88 Ninjas vs. 1. It's in Volume 1. Watch it. Your mouth will stay open the entire scene. My take on that scene is shown above, in her power pose. Just imagine she's wearing a full yellow suit‚Ä¶then wiggle your big toe. </p>

			<h2>18/27</h2>
			<h3>Created 2.12.14</h3>
			<p>Edson Arantes do Nascimento also known simply as Pel√© was born in 1940 in Brasil and was named after Thomas Edison. He was originally nicknamed Dico by his family but he received the nickname "Pel√©" during his school days, when it is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favorite player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bil√©, which he misspoke but the more he complained the more it stuck. Pel√© is quoted as saying that he nor his friends have any idea what that name means. In Hebrew, it means "miracle" which seems very appropriate for the best soccer player ever but in actuality, the word has no known meaning in Portuguese.</p>
			<p>Regardless, Pel√© began his professional career at 15 years old for Santos, scoring 4 goals in his first game. At that age I was drinking Capri Sun and figuring out how to download music on a new app called "iTunes". Shortly thereafter, Pel√© made his national debut for Brazil at 16. Again, to compare, I was probably at WaWa vouching that the movie 'Signs' was actually sort of good you guys (I've since redacted this viewpoint). 2 Years later Pel√© played in his first World Cup match, assisting on a goal in his first game. From then on he became a legend setting National and Club team records for all-time goals and being the only soccer player ever to win 3 world cups.</p>
			<p>Towards the tail end of his career Pel√© moved to New York City to play for the NY Cosmos with fellow legends Giorgio Chinaglia of Italy (my Dad's favorite player) and Franz Beckenbauer of Germany. This brought a ton of excitement to soccer in the United States and my dad's stories of this time period helped inspire me to start playing my favorite sport. The Cosmos were incredible, dismantling any team that they played. In his final game, Pel√©'s Cosmos hosted his original club, Santos, in New York. In the stands was not only Pel√©'s father (an amazing soccer player in his own right) but also Muhammad Ali. On the final shot he took, Pel√© scored from a direct free kick. The Cosmos won that game 2-1. </p>
			<p>Viva a lenda. Viva o rei. The legend. The king.</p>

			<p>The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop band from New York City, formed in 1981. For the majority of its career, the group consisted of Michael "Mike D" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam "MCA" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz (vocals, guitar). Originally formed as a four-piece hardcore punk band in 1981 by Diamond (vocals), John Berry (guitar), Yauch (bass) and Kate Schellenbach (drums). After recording one EP, Berry left shortly thereafter, and was replaced by Horovitz. Soon after that Schellenbach left as well.</p>

			<p>They decided to hire a DJ for their live shows and ended up getting an NYU student named Rick Rubin. Heard of him? Rubin began producing records. He then formed Def Jam Recordings and approached the band about producing them for his new label. The Beastie Boys toured with Madonna in 1985 and a year later released their debut album Licensed to Ill. They were 20 (Ad-Rock), 21 (Mike D) and 22 (MCA) years old...</p>

			<p>Mario is a fictional character in the Mario video game franchise, created by Nintendo's Japanese video game designer, Shigeru Miyamoto. Serving as the company's mascot and the eponymous protagonist of the series, Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center upon rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. His younger brother is Luigi. I thought Luigi was older. No idea why, was just convinced. Huh.</p>

			<p>Anyways, Miyamoto originally wanted to create a game using Popeye and Olive Oyl but was unable to acquire a license to use the characters (and would not until 1982), so he ended up making Jumpman (later known as Mario), Donkey Kong, and some broad named Pauline. In the early stages of Donkey Kong (where Mario made his first appearance), Mario was unable to jump (what?), and the focus was to escape a maze. However, Miyamoto enabled Mario to jump, saying "If you had a barrel rolling towards you, what would you do?" Ground breaking quote right there.</p>

			<p>Actually, Miyamoto named Mario "Mr. Video" at first but thought giving him a real name would enable players to connect with him more. Mario was first created as a carpenter but it wasn't until Mario Bros. that Miyamoto decided that Mario should be a plumber with his brother since most of the levels were underground. He then decided that he looked sort of Italian so why not base the game in New York (ayyyyyy). So, in theory, this is the original Jumpman of New York. Wa-hoo!</p>

			<h1>Sanka, you dead mon?</h1>
			<h2>23/27</h2>
			<h3>Created 3.19.14</h3>
			<p>Feel the rhythm! Feel the rhyme! Get on up, its bobsled time! Cool Runnings is an amazing film (very) loosely based on the 1988 Olympic jamaican bobsled team. Emphasis on amazing. And film. More or less it's about Jamaican sprinters who accidentally trip each other during a qualifying race and decide that bobsledding is their best chance to fulfill their dream of making it to the olympics. Makes sense right? In the beginning they are miserable, barely piling into a broken down push cart that they are using to practice in while still in Jamaica (since there is no ice). The best character in the film is Sanka Coffie played by Doug E. Doug. Strong names.</p>
			<p>Sanka is a constant smart ass who carries a "lucky egg" on him at all times that he keeps in the front of his underwear. Anything he says in the film is pure gold but the one that can be used at all times is after anytime they crash. Derice (played by a human named Leon...one name), their captain, asks Sanka if he's dead. Sanka's answer: "Ya mon."</p>

			<h3>Created 3.26.14</h3>
			<p>A Goofy Movie came out in 1995 and is a documentary about a boy, Max Goof, and his father, Goofy. Oh, and a leaning tower of CHEEEEEEZUH. On the last day of school before summer vacation, Max and his best friends P.J. and Bobby (aka Pauly Shore) hijack the auditorium stage in the middle of Principal Mazur's speech, creating a small concert where Max performs, while swinging from the rafters and costumed as the pop singer Powerline. If you don't know the song "Stand Out" by heart we need to have a talk about how we've been friends this long in life. Goofy is my favorite Disney character that is loosely based on me ages 1-28.</p>

			<h1>Phanatic</h1>
			<h2>25/27</h2>
			<h3>Created 4.9.14</h3>
			<p>The Phillie Phanatic is the official mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies. He is a large, furry, green bi-pedal creature with an extendable tongue. If you ask me what kind of animal he is, I will say Phanatic. And I will be correct. End of discussion. According to his official biography, the Phanatic is originally from the Gal√°pagos Islands. Which is similar to North Philly. The Phanatic is acknowledged as one of the best ballpark mascots and is the only thing the @Phillies have going for them this season/decade.</p>
			<p>During the winter after the 1977 season, Dennis Lehman, who thought that the team needed a mascot similar to San Diego's Famous Chicken, created the Phanatic with help from Harrison/Erickson of NYC (now known as Acme Mascots), which had ties with Jim Henson's Muppets. The Phanatic debuted on April 25, 1978, at The Vet, when the Phils played the Chicago Cubs. The Phanatic rides around on an ATV, wanders the stadium, greeting fans and humorously mocking supporters of the opposition or the opposition themselves. His mother, Phoebe, occasionally appears on-field with the Phanatic. He also has a younger cousin Phred, who is rarely seen. Classic Phred. Black sheep of the family. Get a job Phred. </p>
			<p>In his book, current owner and former team VP Bill Giles wrote of the worst decision of his life when it came to the creation of the Phanatic. The design would cost $5,200 for both the costume and the copyright ownership, or $3,900 just for the costume with Harrison/Erickson retaining the copyright. Giles chose to just buy the costume. Five years later, when Giles and his group of investors bought the team from Ruly Carpenter, the franchise paid $250,000 to Harrison/Erickson for the copyright. Whoops-a-daisy. The Phanatic is one of only 2 mascots in the Halls of Cooperstown (the other being SD Chicken). Lastly, The Phanatic also has the dubious distinction of being the most sued mascot in sports. A true Philadelphian.</p>
